Széchenyi Chain Bridge (Lánchíd) is the most famous bridge in the city: the . The Chain Bridge was the first to permanently connect Buda and Pest. At the time of its construction, the bridge was considered to be one of the wonders of the world. The road is hanging on iron chains – hence its name, and is held by the two classicist piers.

What used to be a pub is now a delightful restaurant that prides itself on serving simple home cooked food. The menu includes options like grilled sausages, oven baked flamed pies, and goulash soup. Pest-Buda Bistro is close to the castle and the cathedral, making it the perfect lunch or dinner break with excellent service and a charming seating area outside.

### JAZZ @ Budapest Music Center
SLOVENIJAJAZZ & BEYOND | TEO COLLORI & MOMENTO CIGANO (SI)
Teo Collori & Momento Cigano play an extraordinary medley of gypsy and swing music. It is a project where nostalgia blends with new stories, as the boys perform fresh, original songs, in a style that takes us back to the era of ballrooms, cigars, Charleston and lacquered shoes. Their first record, Hot Club Piran, was chosen as “Album of 2015” at the online music portal of the Slovenian coastal area, Muzikobala. In 2016 their quality was recognized in the USA as well, where the album was published on the renowned Lowtemp label. Their second, Kamerato Muzikante was released recently, in October 2018. The new songs still have roots in gipsy jazz but they also flirt with classical muisc, ethno and even film score.

Teo Collori - guitar
Matija Krečič - violin
Matej Kužel - clarinet
Metod Banko - guitar
Jan Gregorka - double bass
