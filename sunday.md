### Brunch at Central Cafe
Founded in 1887, the Centrál Café is among the oldest of its kind in Budapest. It represents tradition and history, but is also open to new ideas. Its beautiful antique interior of paintings, vintage lights and elaborate wooden surfaces takes you back to 19th-century, even though you’re in the modern-day city centre. The kitchen focuses on Hungarian cuisine and serves excellent desserts as well as fine coffees.

### Dinner at New York Cafe
[Map](https://goo.gl/maps/QzDKNyhhjTL2)

The beating heart of the New York Palace hotel, the New York Café has preserved all the authentic decoration and flair that once made it an inspiration for the enquiring minds of Hungary's cultural and intellectual community. Cast your gaze upwards to the ceiling and you’ll see frescoes by Gusztav Mannheimer and Ferenc Eisenhut, dating back to the mid-1800s. All around you, Venetian glass lamps softly illuminate the marble columns and gilded stuccoes. Enveloped by this Belle Époque charm, you can relish the moment. Enjoy a conversation with your waiter or barman, follow the chef’s recommendations – and soak up the colour and the chatter of one of Europe’s most legendary destinations.

View the menus [here](NewYorkCafeMenu2019January_en.pdf).
Reservation is at 8:00pm.
