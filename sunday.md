### Brunch at Central Cafe
Founded in 1887, the Centrál Café is among the oldest of its kind in Budapest. It represents tradition and history, but is also open to new ideas. Its beautiful antique interior of paintings, vintage lights and elaborate wooden surfaces takes you back to 19th-century, even though you’re in the modern-day city centre. The kitchen focuses on Hungarian cuisine and serves excellent desserts as well as fine coffees.
